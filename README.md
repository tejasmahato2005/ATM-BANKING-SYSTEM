# ATM-BANKING-SYSTEM
ATM uses software applications for performing banking operations, whether you want to withdraw cash, deposit cash or undergo any important fund transfers immediately, it is not exactly convenient to always visit the bank branch and wait in long queues to perform such quick and easy transactions there comes an ATM system that makes these tasks easy.

There are many advantages of an ATM banking system such as 24- hour access to cash, view account balances and mini-statements, transfer funds between accounts, pay your utility bills and can deposit cash, and many more.

This project is designed in such a way that to perform transactions or to make a balance inquiry one should require to enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) using a C programming language.

# 🏦 ATM Banking System in C

This repository contains a **console-based ATM Banking System** implemented in the C programming language.  
It simulates the basic features of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), allowing users to perform banking operations such as **checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, and changing PIN**.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🔑 **User Authentication** (PIN-based login)
- 💰 **Check Balance** – View current account balance
- ➕ **Deposit Money** – Add money to your account
- ➖ **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw available funds
- 🔄 **Change PIN** – Securely update account PIN
- 🚪 **Exit Option** – Safely terminate the session

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the use of:
- **Conditional statements** (`if-else`, `switch-case`)
- **Loops** (menu-driven structure with `while`)
- **Functions** (modular code for operations)
- **Arrays & Variables** (to store balance, PIN, etc.)
- **User Input/Output** in C

---

This mini-project was created to:
- Practice **modular programming** in C
- Implement a **menu-driven system**
- Understand real-world applications of **conditional logic**
- Build a beginner-friendly project simulating a real ATM
